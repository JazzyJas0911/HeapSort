# HeapSort

Create three functions named build_MaxHeap(a), max_heapify(a,i), heap_sort(a).
 1. Request the user to enter a positive integer, and call it n.
 2. Generate n random integers between -10000 to 10000 and save them in array a.
 3. Call heap_sort(a) function to sort the array. In order to sort the array using heapsort, you need to follow the below steps:
 	3.1 Build a max-heap (call the function build_heap(a)).
 	3.2 Remove the root (remove the first element in a):
 4. Determine the average-running time of heap_sort function for n = 10000, and 100 repetitions.
 5. Compare your answer with the average-running time of quicksort and selection sort.
